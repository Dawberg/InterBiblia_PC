How to install the components
-----------------------------

If you're running Delphi 5 or Delphi 6:

- Open CoolTrayIcon_D5.dpk (Delphi 5) or CoolTrayIcon_D6.dpk (Delphi 6)
  either by doubleclicking the file or by selecting "Open Project" inside
  Delphi.

- Click Compile, then Install.

- That's it. The components should be visible in the component palette
  in a tab called "Tray Icons" (if older versions of the components were
  installed they may be found in "Custom").


If you're running other Delphi versions than ver. 5 or 6:

- Select "Install Component" from the "Component" menu item (may vary
  depending on your Delphi version).

- A dialog displays where you must select the components to install and
  the package to install into. I recommend creating a new package, if you
  haven't already done so, rather than installing into the default package.

- Browse for the RegisterTrayIcons.pas file and select OK.

- That's it. The components should be visible in the component palette
  in a tab called "Tray Icons" (if older versions of the components were
  installed they may be found in "Custom").

(Note that in Delphi ver. 2 the component path is limited to 80 characters.
If it's too long it will be partly ignored, which really messes things up.)
