Tray Icon Demos

The following demos are distributed with CoolTrayIcon 4.0.0:

* CoolTrayTest - Main demo of CoolTrayIcon features
* TextTrayTest - Main demo of TextTrayIcon features
* StartHidden  - How to determine at runtime if your app. should start visible or not
* CoolService  - A simple interactive service using CoolTrayIcon

* CustomHint1  - Modifying the common tray icon tooltip, changing the font and colors
* CustomHint2  - Replacing the tray icon tooltip with your own custom tooltip
                 (this is necessary if you need more than 128 chars. in the tooltip)


CustomHint1 was more or less a port of a VB project by Eduardo A. Morcillo 
(http://www.domaindlx.com/e_morcillo).
CustomHint2 was made by Zeljko Avramovic and modified by me.
All other demos were made by me.

If you have a cool demo demonstrating how to accomplish a task with CoolTrayIcon
or TextTrayIcon, send it to me.
